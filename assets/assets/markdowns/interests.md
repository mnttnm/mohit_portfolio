# Me outside work

---
  
I am a fitness freak, I believe that everyone should do some kind of physical activity at for min. Of 40 mins per day.  
I enjoy listening to podcast mostly around technology and self-help. ["Masters of Scale by Ried Hoffmann"](https://www.youtube.com/@mastersofscale1013/featured) is my favorite podcast till date, currently I listen to podcasts from [Andrew hubbermann](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab), [Vishal Khandelwal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjMKtD_3HlbRvX8D1xqOPIchP7ziRcfkD) and The Knowledge Project by Shane Parrish.  
  
I mostly spend my spare time working on my side projects, and updating my knowledge on the topics of human health fitness and personal finance.
