# His Interests

---
  
I am a fitness freak person, I believe that we should do some kind of physical activity at for min. Of 40 mins per day.  
I enjoy listening to podcast mostly around technology and self-help. "Masters of Scale by Ried Hoffmann" is my favorite podcast till date,  
currently I listen to podcasts from hubbermann, Vishal Khandelwal and Tim Ferris.  
  
I mostly spend my spare time working on my side projects and reading/watching non fictional content.  
I am active advisor for education curriculum and methodology in one of my friendâ€™s school in my hometown.
